  ## Description

  README Generator was created for UCF bootcamp class as an application to make creating a README file easier. The user will go through questions about their project and after they are all answered, a README.md will be created using that content. The application was designed to go along with learning and display student ability to utilize knowledge on JavaScript and node.js.
